Project describing the scale and composition of emergency calls for police service in Detroit, United States.

STEPS FOR REPLICATION

**For users familiar R**

- Download or clone the entire GitHub repository to your local machine.
- Download the [open calls for service data](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4f49eb825f564efa9a23cd103c4ba13b_0.csv) and save it in the data folder, naming it 'detroit_16_21.csv'.
- Download the [open shapefile](https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/current-city-of-detroit-neighborhoods/explore?location=42.352721%2C-83.099208%2C11.13) of Detroit neighborhood boundaries. This should be unzipped and the files saved in to the data folder.
- Two scripts in the script folder can be used to replicate the paper's findings. One for the raw counts, one for the time spent on scene. Running these scripts will output the relevant tables and visuals referred to in the paper.
