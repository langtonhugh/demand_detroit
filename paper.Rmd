abstract: In the spirit of a recent contribution by Ratcliffe (2021) published in
  _Crime Science_ this short paper describes the scale and composition of public demand
  for police services in Detroit, United States, during 2019. Findings broadly confirm
  those by Ratcliffe, namely, that a considerable proportion of police time is spent
  resolving a diverse array of (non-criminal) calls for service, including public
  health incidents. The temporal and spatial patterning of different types of public
  demand for police services are often distinct. The data and code to replicate analyses
  are made openly available.

## Introduction

Amidst austerity measures, growing public expectation, and scrutiny, understanding the public demand for police services has become a priority among evidence-based policing researchers and practitioners [@boulton2017calls]. Without a grasp on the scale ('how much?') and composition ('what type?') of police demand, we are likely to observe sub-optimal and inequitable outcomes for the public, the inappropriate distribution of public funds, and unnecessary strain on officers [@ellison2021understanding; @lum2021can]. Understanding the characteristics public demand for the police has become particularly pertinent following recent calls to rethink, and some cases, radically reform, the role and reach of contemporary police forces [@lum2021can].

A study from @ratcliffe2021policing in _Crime Science_ sought to describe the complexity and diversity of public demand for police services in Philadelphia, United States. The study was motivated by the recognition that police spend a considerable proportion of deployed resource resolving incidents which fall outside the traditional crime-fighting role of the police. Instead, the origins of public demand for the police can often be attributed to a lack of supply and/or accessibility failure in other organisations, such as those providing support for people requiring (mental) health assistance [@wood2021can; @van2017law]. The study's findings provided data-driven evidence to suggest that the police indeed spend considerable amounts of time dealing with incidents that could be resolved by other -- often more appropriate -- agencies. Comparable findings were subsequently reported in the United States across multiple (anonymised) police jurisdictions [@lum2021can]. In advance of recent contributions, this short paper aims to describe the public demand for police services in Detroit, United States, using open data and open code which can be used to reproduce the findings (see xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).

## Measuring demand

Using computer aided dispatch (CAD) data from the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) the @ratcliffe2021policing study provided a breakdown of calls for service in 2019. CAD codes, used the describe calls, of which eighty unique descriptions originated from the public and required officer dispatch, were classified into six broad categories: community issues, crime, medical/public health, proactive policing, quality of life, and traffic duties. Recognising that frequency counts of calls for service do not necessarily reflect the amount of consumed police resource, raw counts were adjusted by the time committed by officers to deal with each incident type. Findings indicated that around 55% of officer shift activity time was spent on crime incidents, with the remainder of time allocated to incidents involving medical/public health (9%), the community (7%), proactive policing (5%), quality of life (14%) and traffic duties (11%). Focusing on medical/public health incidents, findings also indicated that calls concentrated in particular areas of the city and during particular hours of the day.

The data used for this study covers the city of Detroit in Michigan, United States. The City of Detroit authority publish calls for service data through their open data portal.^[Accessible via https://data.detroitmi.gov/]. The raw data includes both citizen-initiated 911 calls to request police services and officer-initiated calls spanning back to September 2016. In alignment with @ratcliffe2021policing, the data used here is subset for the year 2019 and excludes those calls initiated by an officer. For each incident, the response time and time on the scene are reported. In sum, these comprise the total time officers spent on the incident. Incidents which had a total allocated time of zero minutes (or negative values) were excluded, leaving 301,490 calls for service throughout the year. Each incident has a _calldescription_ variable which describes the nature of the call. There were 207 unique call description categories which in the interests of parsimony and ease of interpretation were recoded into 101 categories. ^[We refer readers to the corresponding GitHub repository for further details on how call descriptions were combined (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx). Readers unfamiliar with R code can review the reference table entitled 'categorisation summary'. Each call description was then categorised into the six demand type classifications used in @ratcliffe2021policing]. For each of the six demand types, an 'other' classification was generated for those incident types were consumed less than 0.2% of police time during the year. This left a total of 48 categories for the reported breakdown.

Each incident also has corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates and a call timestamp. Due to irregularities in geocoding, likely due unknown locations for some calls, 2% of incidents were excluded from the spatial descriptive analyses.
